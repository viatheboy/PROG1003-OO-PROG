## PROG1003 - Object Oriented Programming
Norwegian University of Science and Technology <br>
<a href='https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/PROG1003#tab=omEmnet'>Course Homepage</a>

Language used: C++.

This repository consists of assignments done alone by me, and the group project completed by me and two fellow students.
It also has a folder that holds smaller tasks, that were not compulsory. Task descriptions are not available if not specified in the files.

The course teaches the principles of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. Builds on the course covering the fundamentals of programming, and teaches how to utilize objects in programming with detailed implementations in C++.
